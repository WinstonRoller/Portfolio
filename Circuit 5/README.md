# Circuit 5: Looping Shift Register & Point System
## Concept:
For our final project we needed to create a point system for Pac-man, where if he lands on the same spot a pellet is, the player will get a point. I also wasnt satifsied that we werent gonna do any looping so I wanted to get that working as well.

## How it works:
