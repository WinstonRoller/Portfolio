# Project: Subway Surfers
## Concept:
The goal of this project was to recreate the game Subway Surfers. In the game you dodge a series of obstacles that come at you by moving left and right. There are also coins placed throughout the game that you pick up to increase your score. For the project I used a 4x4 RGB LED grid as the display. Red represents the obstacles, green represents the player, and blue represents the coins. There are 32 "layers" of obstacles that player has to move through. After the 32 are done it loops back, so you could potentially go forever.
