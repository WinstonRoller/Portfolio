# Circuit 4: Sequential Adder/Subtracter
## Concept:
An Adder/Subtracter that lets you keep adding and subtracting. Now instead of only 2 numbers you can add or subtract as many as you like.
## How it works:
It works like a typical adder subtracter circuit, instead instead of 2 switches that determine the numbers being added, its 1 switch and a set of flip-flops. You enter one number in the switchs. Then you click the submit button. This will be the number you will add/subtract from. The second number you enter will be added on or subtracted from your first number. Once you hit submit, the answer of those 2 numbers will be loaded into the flip-flop, and you can keep adding/subtracting forever. The circuit will warn you of overflow if the number you want to add or subtract from will result overflow if you submit. The Flip-Flops D value is controlled by the Sum of the corresponding adder bit.
