# Circuit 7: Finite State Lock Circuit
## Concept:
After learning about finite state machines, I realized it would be a good fit for my previous lock circuit and wanted to reiterate on it. It is a combination of both a Mealy and Moore machine. The reason for the Mealy machine is because if I had used only a Moore it would have required 3 variable assignments, but an issue with the moore machine is that the last code entered would "unlock" the circuit without hitting the submit button
